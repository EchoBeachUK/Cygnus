# Cygnus

I wanted to write a Spectrum game from scratch that was based on one of my favorite games from the 80s. I wanted to see how long it would take to create. To put myself under the pressure that those programmers from the 80s had to endure, writing games and getting them out on time.

Those programmers had weeks to get a blockbuster game written. This game took three years to write where time sitting down in the evenings was spent writing lumps of code. Most of the time was spent fixing bugs. This game is so vast that I had to release as a beta.

Cygnus Alpha was a quick idea that came up on speaking to a few key people on social media. I mentioned that I was writing this game but I needed ideas. I was presented with a list of ideas that just kept growing as I was writing them into the game.

The game has been written on the Z80 assembler called Zeus which is freely downloaded.http://www.desdes.com/products/oldfiles/index.htm Without this and the help from Simon Brattel, this game would not have been possible.

The game was formed by a collaboration of people on social media.
