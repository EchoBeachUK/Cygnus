# Cygnus

I wanted to write a Spectrum game from scratch that was based on one of my favorite games from the 80s. I wanted to see how long it would take to create. To put myself under the pressure that those programmers from the 80s had to endure, writing games and getting them out on time.

Those programmers had weeks to get a blockbuster game written. This game took three years to write where time sitting down in the evenings was spent writing lumps of code. Most of the time was spent fixing bugs. This game is so vast that I had to release as a beta.

Cygnus Alpha was a quick idea that came up on speaking to a few key people on social media. I mentioned that I was writing this game but I needed ideas. I was presented with a list of ideas that just kept growing as I was writing them into the game.

The game has been written on the Z80 assembler called Zeus which is freely downloaded.http://www.desdes.com/products/oldfiles/index.htm Without this and the help from Simon Brattel, this game would not have been possible.

The game was formed by a collaboration of people on social media.

Game coding by me, Steve Broad.

I want to release the source code next year 2021 so that this can develop in the Z80 dev community.

The game is heavily influenced by John Hollis's Spectrum Timegate game from the early 80s. John has been kind enough to give me permission to use the original ideas to create Cygnus Alpha. His site is here: http://www.hollis.co.uk/john/

Cygnus also has elements of Star Raiders from the old 8 bit Atari.

Cover text fonts use Futura font used in many Stanley Kubrick's film titles such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Eyes Wide Shut.

Please feel free to contact me at stevebroad@yahoo.com if you are interested in playing a part in the development of the source code. Who knows, perhaps this will develop into something even bigger than it is now. There is a lot of room for code compression to fit in more.
